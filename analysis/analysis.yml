    This is an example of an analysis model.
    dbt's notion of models makes it easy for data teams to version control and collaborate on data transformations. 
    Sometimes though, a certain sql statement doesn't quite fit into the mold of a dbt model. 
    These more "analytical" sql files can be versioned inside of your dbt project using the analysis functionality of dbt.
